Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
	Class components can use lifecycle hooks, such as render()

Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
	componentDidMount() - waits to render UI until the state is updated
	componentDidUpdate() - updates when the DOM changes
	componentWillUnmount() - called right before the component is unmounted and destroyed, cleanup actions would go here

What is the purpose of a custom hook?
	Pull logic out of files. Allows you to use reusable useComponents, like useForm

Why is it important to test our apps?
	You can code what the functionality of the app is, so if anyone needs to change anything,
	they'll know if their changes will effect the functionality of the app
