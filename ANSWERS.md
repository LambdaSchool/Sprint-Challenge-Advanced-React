- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
To minimize the risk of bugs getting into the production code. Automated testing makes it possible to reduce manpower and margin for error. Testing makes it easier to trust the code, and acts as a safety net when making changes. It also encourages programmers to write more testable (i.e. concise) code.
