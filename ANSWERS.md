- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

You would use class components over function components if you need to use state or lifecycle hooks in the component.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

1. constructor() --> serves the component with initial state data
2. render() --> returns what your component will render to the screen
3. componentDidMount() --> called immediately after a component mounts, good place to load remote data (e.g. HTTP requests)

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

The purpose of a custom hook is to extract shared component logic into resuable functions.

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

It is important to test our apps to minimize the risk of bugs going into production.
