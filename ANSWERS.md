- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)
        - I would use class components over functional components when I need to keep track of some kind of state.
- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
        -componentDidMount- Fires only when a component first renders
        -componentDidUpdate- Fires anytime a component updates (like useEffect)
        -componentDidUnmount- Fires when the component dies and cleans up. 
- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
        -Custom hooks allow you to write a function that holds stateful logic once and reuse it throughout your code. Keeping code DRY and more readable. 
- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
        It is important to test apps because it helps use write cleaner, better code. Provides a safety net so someone doesn't come in later and break your code. It alows for easier code maintance as well.
