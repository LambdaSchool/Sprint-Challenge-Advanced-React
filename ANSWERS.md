- [1] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

 1-	You would class components over function components because class components can hold state or data. When state updates, render gets called, state gets passed around as props and changes when props change too.

- [2] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

 2- The three lifecycle methods are mounting, updating and un-mounting. Mounting, or birth phase, is when the component is being created. Updating, or growth phase where setState can be used to change the componentâ€™s state data and then render is called. Un-mounting, or the death phase, is when the component is removed and no longer available.
