 Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
1) There is no reason to create new class components. function components can do all class components can plus Hooks.

 Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
 2) >constructon method is used to set the original state. >setState method allows the component to be reactive. > componenetwillunmount method stops the component and state to stop changing or being active. 

 What is the purpose of a custom hook?
 3)ReUseable, customizable  code that can hold state.

 Why is it important to test our apps?
 I assist with debugging the code by compairing a code's expected outcome and actual resaults.
